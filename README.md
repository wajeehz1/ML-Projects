# ML-Projects
This repository aims to showcase the machine learning projects I worked on using Python.
The first project was to predict the solubility of molecules, and since there are many features (x's) that can be used to predict the solubility of a molecule, I have used Multivariate Linear Regression Model to this specific problem.
